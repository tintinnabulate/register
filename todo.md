# TODO
1. Use one.com to send out verification email
2. Make /signup the landing page (not /register)
3. Beautify the signup form
4. Add form fields to /register to match https://eurypaa2018.com ?
5. Use Braintree? https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/braintree-in-europe-and-canada/ Stripe only supported in 26 countries :(

# 1.

* OK does part2 have a consent drop down yes/no for GDPR Compliance?
* We are collecting/storing there email/data
* Is there a payment option other than Credit/Debit card?
* Can it be wiped? Reused fresh again the next year? Or data backed up as required and process restarted?
* Can one person do multiple registrations Eg 1 AA 2 ALANON and 2 Alateen with a combined bill?
* Can we connect both Stripe and PayPal to the app?
* And the host acct iban etc for direct deposit

# 2.

* Does the form have  validation ? Eg needed fields
* Is the user journey very likely to see the person already signed up before getting to registry?
* If not, having an auto redirect on initial submit might be good
* Plus, might there be a way to get both sign up and registry all in one?
* Finally... initial field?
* With shibboleth targetedID people could submit surnames knowing it would only be shared with the board...but prob not necessarry!
